# dining menu generator
Web app that allows a "customer" to input menu data and get a stylized dining menu

## design plan so far
*use forms to collect data from web-app  
*use data to populate webpage with dynamic size (similar to dynamic tables, but using sections)  
*stylize that page  
*figure out what API to use (knowledge, graph, google maps, yelp, more to consider...)
 
*updats: 
*    Apply for the Google Map Embed API key at https://code.google.com/apis/console

*more to come...  

## data to collect from forms
*menu item  
*description  
*price  
*daliy/weekly specials?  
*happy hour offerings?  
*beverages  
*pictures(knowledge graph?)  
*more to come...  

# journal of project progress/issues/challenges/sucesses
*chose blank bootstrap template to build menu on 
*issues trying to figure out how to use forms to create dynamic menu, going to start with a very simple plain text to do list but have multiple items per add 
*issues getting to do list to work, html is fine, need to get javascript to work to add to the webpage, going to work through the code later today or tomorrow
